I want to calculate the probability of winning a territory in relation to how many armies present in the duel.

__I specify that the number of attackers corresponds precisely to the number of dice that will be rolled and not to the precise number of armies in the territory of the attacker since we know that the attacker will always count one less army.__

Example:
- number of armies in the attacking territory = 4
- number of armies in the territory to be conquered = 2
- result: 3 attacking dice vs 2 defending dice

Any hints will be greatly appreciated :)
Enjoy.
