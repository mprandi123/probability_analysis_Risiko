__Goal__

This notebook calculates the probability of conquering a territory in Risk, focusing on how many dice are rolled based on the available armies. By rule, the attacker always keeps one army in reserve, so the number of attacking dice is one less than the total armies in the attacking territory (up to 3 dice). The defender can roll up to 2 dice depending on the defending armies.

_Example_

Attacking territory has 4 armies → Attacker can roll 3 dice
Defending territory has 2 armies → Defender can roll 2 dice

Any hints will be greatly appreciated :)
Enjoy.
